Okay, here's a concise description focusing solely on the "Distributor" role and their work within the Street Food Ecosystem application.

Distributor Role - Responsibilities and Workflow

In the Street Food Ecosystem application, a Distributor acts as a wholesale supplier, primarily serving the Retail Shop Owners. Their main objective is to provide the necessary inventory in bulk to retail shops, which in turn supply the street food vendors.

Key Responsibilities:

Product Catalog Management:

Maintain a detailed list of wholesale products they offer (e.g., ingredients, packaging, supplies).

Update product descriptions, bulk pricing, and available stock levels.

Upload images for their products.

Order Fulfillment (for Retail Shops):

Receive and process incoming bulk orders placed by various Retail Shop Owners.

Review order details, confirm stock availability, and update the order status (e.g., "Processing," "Shipped").

Inventory Management:

Track and manage their own warehouse or supply stock levels for all wholesale products.

Monitor low-stock items to ensure timely replenishment.

Delivery Coordination (to Retail Shops):

Oversee or arrange the logistics for delivering bulk orders directly to the Retail Shops.

Update the delivery status of these outgoing orders.

Workflow within the Application:

Setup: A Distributor registers on the platform and sets up their profile and wholesale product catalog.

Shop Ordering: Retail Shop Owners browse the Distributor's available products within the application and place bulk orders to replenish their own inventory.

Order Processing: The Distributor receives real-time notifications for new orders from shops. They access the Distributor portal to view order details, mark items for preparation, and update the order's status.

Shipment: Once prepared, the Distributor initiates and tracks the shipment of the bulk order to the designated Retail Shop address.

Confirmation: The Distributor marks the order as "Delivered" once the Retail Shop confirms receipt.

Interaction with Other Roles:

Works with Retail Shop Owners: Distributors are the direct suppliers to Retail Shop Owners.

Indirectly Supports Street Food Vendors: By ensuring Retail Shops are well-stocked, Distributors enable Street Food Vendors to consistently find and order the supplies they need.

Manages Deliveries (to Shops): Distributors are responsible for the logistics of getting products to shops, potentially engaging their own delivery methods.

In essence, the Distributor keeps the retail supply chain flowing, ensuring that local shops always have the necessary goods to fulfill orders from street food vendors.
