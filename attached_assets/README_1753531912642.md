## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Street Food Ecosystem Platform! This application aims to streamline the supply chain for street food vendors by connecting them directly with retail shop owners and facilitating efficient delivery through a network of delivery agents. The platform offers a multi-user experience with dedicated logins and functionalities for each role: Street Food Vendor, Retail Shop Owner, and Delivery Agent.

## 2. Features

* **Multi-User Authentication:** Secure logins for Street Food Vendors, Retail Shop Owners, and Delivery Agents.
* **Vendor Dashboard:**
    * Browse products from various retail shops.
    * Filter and sort shops based on ratings.
    * Add items to cart and place orders.
    * Track order status in real-time.
* **Retail Shop Owner Dashboard:**
    * Receive and manage incoming orders from vendors.
    * Update order statuses (e.g., "Preparing", "Ready for Pickup").
    * Manage product listings and inventory (future scope/detailed implementation).
* **Delivery Agent Dashboard:**
    * View available delivery requests.
    * Accept and manage delivery tasks.
    * Update delivery status (e.g., "Picked Up", "On the Way", "Delivered").
    * Access navigation assistance for pick-up and drop-off locations.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design with smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with modern technologies for future expansion.

## 3. Tech Stack

This project leverages a powerful and modern set of technologies to ensure a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application.

### Frontend

* **React.js:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create reusable UI components, making the frontend development efficient and maintainable. It powers the dynamic dashboards and interactive elements for all user types.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs directly in your HTML. Tailwind enables rapid UI development and ensures consistent styling across the application without writing custom CSS from scratch.
* **Framer Motion:** A production-ready motion library for React. Framer Motion is used to implement smooth and engaging animations and transitions throughout the application, enhancing the overall user experience and making the interface feel more dynamic and responsive.

### Backend

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling a unified language for both frontend and backend development. It's ideal for building fast and scalable network applications.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express.js provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, allowing us to easily build RESTful APIs to handle requests from the frontend, manage routes, and interact with the database.

### Database & Storage

* **Supabase (Database):** An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a PostgreSQL database. Supabase offers a powerful and flexible relational database solution for storing all application data, including user profiles, product listings, orders, ratings, and more. Its real-time capabilities can be leveraged for instant updates.
* **Supabase (Storage):** Supabase also provides object storage for files. This will be used to store assets like product images, shop logos, or user profile pictures, ensuring efficient and scalable file management.

### Authentication

* **Firebase Authentication:** A comprehensive authentication service provided by Google Firebase. Firebase Auth offers secure and easy-to-implement authentication methods (email/password, social logins, etc.). It manages user sign-up, login, and session management, providing a robust and scalable authentication solution that integrates seamlessly with our backend for authorization purposes.

## 4. Project Structure

The project is typically structured into `client` (for the React frontend) and `server` (for the Node.js/Express backend) directories.
